To store nba data from Kaggle 

I will use this as a place to store my code and progress.

Actually, this is 3rd day since i started watching that data engineering project 

Pretty cool!

Today i will imitate what i have learned from the video and create an NBA dataset to use in Synapse.

The first step is uploading the files from Kaggle. 

Since i dont know how to get the data from Kaggle API, we will manually download it. 

I will get to Synapse analytics and start a pipeline.
